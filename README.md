# [Tailwind Toolbox](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/) - [Starter Template](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/setup)

It's pretty straight forward to setup [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com/) and give it a test spin using the CDN version. However, as mentioned on the Tailwind site, you need to setup Tailwind using npm in order to start customising Tailwind.

*Note: This starter template is for Tailwind CSS version 1 beta 3 (which is pretty much the [final version](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1108450684783849472))

If you want the starter template for version 0.7.4, then please [download it from here](https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/StarterTemplate/archive/v0-7-4.zip)*

## Setup Guide
* Download [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Download the [Tailwind Starter Template](https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/StarterTemplate/archive/master.zip)
* Open ```package.json``` and then edit the follow section of the file to match your project

```"name": "TailwindStarterTemplate",
"version": "1.0.0",
"description": "Tailwind Starter Template",
"license" : "MIT",
"repository": {
    "type" : "git",
    "url" : "https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/StarterTemplate.git"
},
```

Refer to https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json for guidance

* Open your node command prompt/terminal and navigate to your 'project-name' folder and create the `node_modules` directory

   ```npm install or npm update```

* Refresh the Tailwind.js file

   ```npm run del:js && npm run create:js```

* Re-create the initial css file

## Tweaking
* Customise the tailwind.config.js and tailwind.config.css to create the tailwind.css for your project
