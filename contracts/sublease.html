Arcology NYC is a participatory co-living
    platform, community home, and real estate property that is a project of the Invisible College.
    Its residents are invited to contribute to it,
    leave it better than they find it, and ultimately help it achieve decentralized autonomy.
    Arcology NYC hosts a mix of
    short-term and long-term residents and a limited number of hacker residencies
    in the winter-time.
    Rather than host and guest,
    Sublessor and Sublessee are temporary housemates who agree to clean up after themselves,

    their stays. The following concrete rules help promote the goals and nature of Arcology ideals:

  1. Feel free to make or discuss improvements to the facilities in the Slack #coworking channel.
Ask your house captain (Sublessor) for any tools, materials, resources, or project examples or suggestions.

  1. Wash your own dishes and let them dry in the dishwasher.
  1. Take out the trash (black can) and recycling (white can) when they are full to the bins
