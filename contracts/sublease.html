The Sublessor and the Sublessee both agree that the Sublessee shall lease from

respectful housemates on the following terms:

## <span class="header">Nature</span>

Arcology NYC is a participatory co-living
    platform, community home, and real estate property that is a project of the Invisible College.
    Its residents are invited to contribute to it,
    leave it better than they find it, and ultimately help it achieve decentralized autonomy.
    Arcology NYC hosts a mix of
    short-term and long-term residents and a limited number of hacker residencies
    in the winter-time.
    Rather than host and guest,
    Sublessor and Sublessee are temporary housemates who agree to clean up after themselves,
    and help other housemates feel safe and supported in pursuing their creative and learning goals during
    their stays. The following concrete rules help promote the goals and nature of Arcology ideals:

  1. Feel free to make or discuss improvements to the facilities in the Slack `#home` channel.
Ask your house captain (Sublessor) for any tools, materials, resources, or project examples or suggestions.
  1. No shoes inside the home. Please take them off in the entryway.
  1. Wash your own dishes and let them dry in the dishwasher.
  1. Take out the trash (black can) and recycling (white can) when they are full to the bins
      outside the front door (black bin and blue bin).
  1. Quiet hours from midnight to 9am every day.

  <ul class="projectList">
  </ul>

## <span class="header">Security Deposit, Utilities</span>

The Sublessee will pay a fully refundable security deposit of
<span class="depositAmount blank"></span>
to the Sublessor included in the Total Payment as described above as part of
the Move-In Payment.

The Sublessee agrees to surrender and deliver the subleased premises in the same condition as

refund the Sublessee the deposit at the end of the term on the Move-Out Date
via any of the supported payment methods listed in the next section, at the
choice of the Sublessee, less any of the following expenses.

  * A proportional share of utilities (electricity, internet)
    <div class="type-days" style="display: none;">used during the
      <span class="subleaseDays blank"></span> days,</div>
    as reported by bills received by utility company
    at the end of each calendar month, divided by the 12 people living in the house.
  * Any physical damage, major holes in walls, scratches / dents / furnitures / lost keys
    that need to be repaired or replaced.

</div>

## <span class="header">Staking and Shares</span>

Any Deposit Payment that is held by Arcology should be applied to the deposit of the master
lease. If the Master Deposit is defaulted for lack of paying the Master Rent or damage
to the property that has not been repaired by the Master Move-out Date,
the Deposit Amounts of long-term residents at the Move-Out Date will experience a
corresponding loss.

The rest of this section is aspirational and has not been implemented yet in house software.
It reflects a tentative direction of Arcology as a cooperative home, and may change
without warning. In future
subleases, this section will become increasingly detailed and replace words of
the form "should"
with words of the form "is" or "does".

Residents of Arcology can earn stake (shares) in the home, which gives them a
right to earn dividends from house profits and conversely participate in risks of default
on the master lease.

Profits from the home may be distributed proportionally to residents holding shares
(shareholders) at periodic intervals. Some shares hold a fix dividend rate and should
be paid first (preferred shares).

## <span class="header">Payment Methods and Return of Deposit</span>
