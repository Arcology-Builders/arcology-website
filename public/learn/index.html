    <h1>Arcology Learning</h1>

    <p>Our work at <a href="https://arcology.builders">Arcology Builders</a> is
       supported by our educational mission, which is to help students learn
       computer science and computer engineering, become more self-reliant,
       experience confidence and success, and have fun while doing it.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Methods</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        We accept students for an entire quarter or for a major class project.
      </li>
      <li>
        We teach through screensharing and remote desktop. All work and typing is
        done on the student's computer through the student's fingertips, to help
        solidify concepts through practice and tactile feedback.
      </li>
      <li>
        We practice pair programming and live coding.
