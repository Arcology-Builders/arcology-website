<h1>Staking and Governance for Arcology</h1>

# <span class="header">Staking and Shares</span>

This section is aspirational and has not been implemented yet in house software.
It reflects a tentative direction of Arcology as a cooperative home, and may change
without warning. In future
subleases, this section will become increasingly detailed and replace words of
the form "should"
with words of the form "is" or "does".

Residents of Arcology can earn stake (shares) in the home, which gives them a
right to earn dividends from house profits and conversely participate in risks of default
on the master lease.

Profits from the home may be distributed proportionally to residents holding shares
(shareholders) at periodic intervals. Some shares hold a fix dividend rate and should
be paid first

Any Deposit Payment that is held by Arcology should be applied to the deposit of the master
lease. If the Master Deposit is defaulted for lack of paying the Master Rent or damage
to the property that has not been repaired by the Master Move-out Date,
the Deposit Amounts of long-term residents at the Move-Out Date will experience a
corresponding loss.
